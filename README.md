# Data-Science-Intensive
A 12 weeks of intensive data science training process for becoming a data scientist

Unit 1: Programming Tools 

•	Python, iPython Notebook, matplotlib, Pandas, Git/Github

Unit 2: Deep Dive into Pandas for Data Wrangling

•	Data in files: Work with a variety of sources from unstructured/semi-structured text files (.txt) to delimited/structured/nested format files like excel, csv, json, xml etc.

•	Data in Databases: Get an overview of relational and NoSQL databases and practice data manipulation with SQL.

Unit 3: Inferential Statistics

•	theory and application of inferential statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, statistical significance, correlation and regression, A/B Testing

Unit 4: Machine Learning 

•	Scikit-learn, supervised and unsupervised learning

•	Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision trees, Regression, clustering, recommender systems

•	Advice for applying machine learning

•	Dimensionality reduction

•	Validation and evaluation of machine learning

Unit 5: Capstone Project

•	Created a fast pipeline to process a large dataset with more than 140,000 data records and 1,900 features.

•	Converted categorical and timestamp features into numerical data, and applied statistical analysis, data cleaning, feature selection on the data.

•	Built and validated different machine learning models using Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn.

•	Evaluated the final model and achieved good performance with AUC score.
